= Assignment: Engine Degradation

== Predicting remaining usefull life (RUL)

Remaining useful life (RUL) is the time at which a system or a component will no longer perform its intended function. This lack of performance is most often a failure beyond which the system can no longer be used to meet desired performance.

=== Data

* The description of the dataset is in the Data.zip archive in the readme.txt file.

=== Tasks of the assignment

- Perform an exploratory analysis of the data.
- Develop a predictive model for the remaining usefull life of the engine and report its accuracy in terms of R-squared and RMSE error.
- Explain your process and chosen model.

We suggest you to use Jupyter notebook for this assignment.
